==== Ring Middleware

===== Problem

Ring gives you query strings, but you'd really rather work with a parsed map.

===== Solution

Since Ring works with regular Clojure data and functions, you can easily define
middleware as functions-returning-functions. Define a middleware that modifies
the request by adding a parsed version of the query string to the request
before passing it on to the handler:

[source, clojure]
----
(ns ringtest
  (:require
    [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty]
    [clojure.string :as str]
    clojure.pprint))

(defn parse-query-string
  "Parse a query string to a hash-map"
  [qs]
  (if (> (count qs) 0) ; Don't operate on nils or empty strings
    (apply hash-map (str/split qs #"[&=]"))))

(defn wrap-query
  "Add a :query parameter to incoming requests that contains a parsed
  version of the query string as a hash-map"
  [handler]
  (fn [req]
    (let [parsed-qs (parse-query-string (:query-string req))
          new-req (assoc req :query parsed-qs)]
      (handler new-req))))

(defn handler [req]
  (let [name (get (:query req) "name")]
    {:status 200
     :body (str "Hello, " (or name "World"))}))

(defn -main []
  ;; Run the server on port 3000
  (jetty/run-jetty (wrap-query handler) {:port 3000}))
----

===== Discussion

Since Ring handlers operate on regular Clojure maps, it's very easy to write middleware
that wraps a handler. Here, we write a middleware that modifies the request
before passing it to the handler. If the original request looked like this:

[source, clojure]
----
{:query-string "x=1&y=2"
 ; ... and the rest
 }
----

Then the request received by the handler becomes:

[source, clojure]
----
{:query-string "x=1&y=2"
 :query {"x" "1" "y" "2"}
 ; ... and the rest
 }
----

However, you don't need to write your own middleware for this. Ring provides
a number of middlewares to add to your app, including one called `params` that
does the same as the middleware we just wrote but better:

[quote, Ring Documentation]
----
**wrap-params**

Middleware to parse urlencoded parameters from the query string and form
body (if the request is a urlencoded form). Adds the following keys to
the request map:
  :query-params - a map of parameters from the query string
  :form-params  - a map of parameters from the body
  :params       - a merged map of all types of parameter
Takes an optional configuration map. Recognized keys are:
  :encoding - encoding to use for url-decoding. If not specified, uses
              the request character encoding, or "UTF-8" if no request
              character encoding is set.
----

You are in no way limited to using one middleware.  Usually, you'll at
least want to use the cookie, session, and params middleware.  One concise way to wrap your handler
with several middlewares is to use the `->` macro:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[ring.middleware.session :refer [wrap-session]])
(require '[ring.middleware.cookies :refer [wrap-cookies]])
(require '[ring.middleware.params :refer [wrap-params]])
(def wrapped-handler
  (-> handler
    wrap-cookies
    wrap-params
    wrap-session))
