=== Creating templates for web applications with Selmer

//Author: Dmitri Sotnikov

===== Problem

You want to create server side page templates using syntax similar to Django and Jinja. You want to be able
to insert dynamic content and use template inheritance to structure the templates.

===== Solution

Use Selmer to create your template and call it with a context map containing the dynamic content.

First, add Selmer to your project file:

.project.clj
[source,clojure]
----
(defproject selmer-templating "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
            :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.5.1"]
                           [selmer "0.4.0"]])
----

A Selmer template is an HTML file with special tags that is populated with dynamic
content at runtime. A simple template might look as follows:

.src/views/templates/base.html
[source, html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <header>

      <h1>{{header}}</h1>

      <ul id="navigation">

        {% for item in nav-items %}
        <li>
            <a href="{{item.link}}">{{item.name}}</a>
        </li>
        {% endfor %}

      </ul>
    </header>
  </body>
</html>
----

The template can then be rendered by calling the +selmer.parser/render-file+ function:

[source, clojure]
----
(ns selmer-templating
  (:require [selmer.parser :refer [render-file]))

(render-file "views/templates/base.html"
             {:header "Hello Selmer"
              :nav-items [{:name "Home" :link "/"}
                          {:name "About" :link "/about"}]})
----

When +render-file+ runs it will populate the tags with the content provided.

We can apply filters to variables for additional post-processing at runtime.
Below, we use the +upper+ filter to convert our heading to upper case:

[source, html]
----
<h1>{{header|upper}}</h1>
----

We can extract parts of the template into individual snippets using the +include+ tag. For example,
if we wanted to define the header in a separate file we could do the following:

.src/views/templates/header.html
[source, html]
----
<header>

  <h1>{{header}}</h1>

  <ul id="navigation">

    {% for item in nav-items %}
    <li>
        <a href="{{item.link}}">{{item.name}}</a>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}

  </ul>
</header>
----

.src/views/templates/base.html
[source, html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <body>

    {% include "views/templates/header.html" %}

  </body>
</html>
---- 

The +include+ tag will simply be replaced by the contents of the file it points to when the template 
is compiled.

We can also extend our base template when we create individual pages.
To do that we would first define a block in our base template. This will serve as an anchor
for the child template to override.

.src/views/templates/base.html
[source, html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <body>

    {% include "views/templates/header.html" %}

    {% block content %}
    {% endblock %}

  </body>
</html>
---- 

The child template will reference the parent using the +extends+ tag and define its own
content for the +content+ block:

.src/views/templates/home.html
[source, html]
----
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}

<h1>This is the home page of the site</h1>
<p>some exciting content follows</p>

{% endblock %}
---- 

===== Discussion

Selmer provides a powerful and familiar templating tool with many tags and filters for easily acomplishing many common tasks.
It separates the view logic from presentation by design.

Selmer is also performant as it compiles the templates and ensures that only the dynamic content needs to be
evaluated when serving a request.

====== Selmer Concepts

Selmer includes two types of elements, these consists of variables and tags.

Variables are used to render values from the context map on the page.
The +{{+ and +}}+ are used to indicate the start and end of a variable.

In many cases you may wish to post-process the value of a variable. For example, you might want to convert it to upper case,
pluralize it, or parse it as a date. Variable filters are used for this purpose.

Tags are used to add various functionality to the template such as looping and conditions. We already saw examples of 
the +for+, +include+, and +extends+ tags above. The tags use +{%+ an +%}+ to define their content.

The default tag characters might conflict with client-side frameworks such as AngularJS.
In this case we can specify custom tags by passing a map containing any of the following keys to the parser:

[source, clojure]
----
:tag-open
:tag-close
:filter-open
:filter-close
:tag-second
:custom-tags
:custom-filters
----

If we wanted to use +[+ and +]+ as our opening and closing tags, we could call the +render+ function as follows:

[source, clojure]
----
(render "[% for ele in foo %] {{I'm not a tag, but the next one is}} [{ele}] [%endfor%]"
        {:foo [1 2 3]}
        {:tag-open \[
         :tag-close \]})
----

The +render+ function works just like +render-file+, except that it accepts the template content as a string.

====== Defining Filters

Selmer provides a rich set of filters that allow decorating the dynamic content. Some of the filters include +capitalize+,
+pluralize+, +hash+, +length+, +sort+ and many others.

However, if you need a custom filter that's not part of the library you can trivially add one yourself.
For example, if we wanted to parse Markdown using the https://github.com/yogthos/markdown-clj[markdown-clj] library
and display it on the page we could write the following filter:

[source, clojure]
----
(ns myapp
 (:require [markdown.core :refer [md-to-html-string]]
           [selmer.filters/add-filter!]))
 
(add-filter! :markdown md-to-html-string)
---- 

We can now use this filter in our templates to render our Markdown content:

[source, clojure]
----
<h2>Blog Posts</h2>
<ul>
  {% for post in posts %}
    <li>{{post.title|markdown|safe}}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
----

Note that we had to chain the +markdown+ filter with the +safe+ filter. This is due to the fact that Selmer escapes
variable content by default. We can change our filter definition to indicate that its content does not need escaping
as follows:

[source, clojure]
----
(add-filter! :markdown (fn [s] [:safe (md-to-html-string s)]))
---- 

====== Defining Tags

Again, we can define custom tags in addition to those already present in the library. This is done by calling the
+selmer.parser/add-tag!+ function.

Let's say we wish to add a tag that will capitalize its contents. We could do that as follows:

[source, clojure]
----
(ns myapp
 (:require [selmer.parser :refer [add-tag!]]))
 
(add-tag! :uppercase
          (fn [args context-map content]
            (.toUpperCase (get-in content [:uppercase :content])))
          :enduppercase)

(render "{% uppercase %}foo {{bar}} baz{% enduppercase %}" {:bar "injected"})
----

====== Inheritance

We already saw some examples of template inheritance above. Each template can extend a single template and include
any number of templates in its content.

The templates can extend templates that themselves extend other templates. In this case the blocks found in the outermost
child will override any other blocks with the same name.
