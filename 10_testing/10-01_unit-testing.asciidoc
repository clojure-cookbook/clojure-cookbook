=== Unit Testing
[role="byline"]
by Daniel Gregoire

==== Problem

You want to test individual units of Clojure code.(((testing, unit testing)))((("Clojure", "clojure.test namespace")))

==== Solution

Clojure includes a unit-testing framework in its +clojure.test+
namespace. It provides ways to name and group tests, make assertions,
report results, and orchestrate test suites. 

For demonstration, imagine you had a +capitalize-entries+ function
that capitalized values in a map. To test this function, define a test
using +clojure.test/deftest+:

[source,clojure]
----
;; A function in namespace com.example.core
(defn capitalize-entries
  "Returns a new map with values for keys 'ks' in the map 'm' capitalized."
  [m & ks]
  (reduce (fn [m k] (update-in m [k] clojure.string/capitalize)) m ks))

;; The corresponding test in namespace com.example.core-test
(require '[clojure.test :refer :all])

;; In a real test namespace, you would also :refer all of the target namespace
;; (require '[com.example.core :refer :all])

(deftest test-capitalize-entries
  (let [employee {:last-name "smith"
                  :job-title "engineer"
                  :level 5
                  :office "seattle"}]
    ;; Passes
    (is (= (capitalize-entries employee :job-title :last-name)
           {:job-title "Engineer"
            :last-name "Smith"
            :office "seattle"
            :level 5}))
    ;; Fails
    (is (= (capitalize-entries employee :office)
           {}))))
----

Run the test with the +clojure.test/run-tests+ function:

[source,clojure]
----
(run-tests)
;; -> {:type :summary, :pass 1, :test 1, :error 0, :fail 1}
;; *out*
;; Testing user
;;
;; FAIL in (test-capitalize-entries) (NO_SOURCE_FILE:13)
;; expected: (= (capitalize-entries employee :office) {})
;;   actual: (not (= {:last-name "smith", :office "Seattle", 
;;                    :level 5, :job-title "engineer"} {}))
;;
;; Ran 1 tests containing 2 assertions.
;; 1 failures, 0 errors.
----

==== Discussion

The preceding example only scratches the surface of what +clojure.test+
provides for unit testing. Let's take a bottom-up look at its other
features.

First, you can improve reporting when an assertion fails by providing
a second argument that explains what the assertion is intended to
test. When you run this test, you will see an extended description of
how the code was expected to behave:

[source,clojure]
----

(is (= (capitalize-entries {:office "space"} :office) {})
    "The employee's office entry should be capitalized.")
;; -> false
;; * out*
;; FAIL in clojure.lang.PersistentList$EmptyList@1 (NO_SOURCE_FILE:1)
;; The employee's office entry should be capitalized.
;; expected: (= (capitalize-entries {:office "space"} :office) {})
;;   actual: (not (= {:office "Space"} {}))
----

For testing a function like +capitalize-entries+ thoroughly, several
use cases need to be considered. To more concisely test numerous
similar cases, use the +clojure.test/are+ macro:

[source,clojure]
----
(deftest test-capitalize-entries
  (let [employee {:last-name "smith"
                  :job-title "engineer"
                  :level 5
                  :office "seattle"}]
    (are [ks m] (= (apply capitalize-entries employee ks) m)
         [] employee
         [:not-a-key] employee
         [:job-title] {:job-title "Engineer"
                       :last-name "smith"
                       :level 5
                       :office "seattle"}
         [:last-name :office] {:last-name "Smith"
                               :office "Seattle"
                               :level 5
                               :job-title "engineer"})))
----

The first two parameters to +are+ set up a testing pattern: given a
sequence of keys +ks+ and a map +m+, call +capitalize-entries+ for
those keys on the original +employee+ map and assert that the return
value equals +m+. 

Writing out multiple use cases in a declarative
syntax makes it easier to catch errors and untreated edge cases, such
as the +NullPointerException+ that will be thrown for the
`[:not-a-key] employee` assertion pair in the preceding test.(((truthiness)))

Unlike testing frameworks for other popular dynamic languages,
Clojure's built-in assertions are minimal and simple. The +is+ and
+are+ macros check test expressions for "truthiness" (i.e., that those
expressions return neither +false+ nor +nil+, in which case they pass).
Beyond this, you can also check for +thrown?+ or +thrown-with-msg?+ to
test that a certain +java.lang.Throwable+ (error or exception) is
expected:

[source,clojure]
----
(is (thrown? IndexOutOfBoundsException (nth [] 1)))
----

Above the level of individual assertions, +clojure.test+ also provides
facilities for calling functions before or after tests run. In the
+test-capitalize-entries+ test, we defined an ad hoc +employee+ map for
testing, but you could also read in external data to be shared across
multiple tests by registering a data-loading function as a "fixture."
The +clojure.test/use-fixtures+ multimethod allows registering Clojure
functions to be called either before or after each test, or before or
after an entire namespace's test suite. The following example defines
and registers three fixture functions:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clojure.edn :as edn])

(def test-data (atom nil))

;; Assuming you have a test-data.edn file...
(defn load-data "Read a Clojure map from test data in a file."
  [test-fn]
  (reset! test-data (edn/read-string (slurp "test-data.edn")))
  (test-fn))

(defn add-test-id "Add a unique id to the data before each test."
  [test-fn]
  (swap! test-data assoc :id (java.util.UUID/randomUUID))
  (test-fn))

(defn inc-count "Increment a counter in the data after each test runs."
  [test-fn]
  (test-fn)
  (swap! test-data update-in [:count] (fnil inc 0)))

(use-fixtures :once load-data)
(use-fixtures :each add-test-id inc-count)

;; Tests...
----

You can think about fixture functions as forming a pipeline through
which each test is passed as a parameter, which we called +test-fn+ in
the preceding example. Take +inc-count+, for example. It is the job of this
fixture to invoke the +test-fn+ function, continuing the pipeline, and
afterward, to increment a count (i.e., "do some work"). Each fixture
decides whether to invoke +test-fn+ before or after its own work
(compare the +add-test-id+ function with the +inc-count+ function),
while the +clojure.test/use-fixtures+ multimethod controls whether
each registered fixture function is run only once for all tests in a
namespace or once for each test.

Finally, with a firm understanding of how to develop individual
Clojure test suites, it is important to consider how you organize and
run those suites as part of your project's build. Although Clojure
allows defining tests for functions anywhere in your code base, you
should keep your testing code in a separate directory that is only
added to the JVM classpath when needed (e.g., during development and
testing). It is conventional to name your test namespaces after the
namespaces they test, so that a file located at
_<project-root>/src/com/example/core.clj_ with namespace
+com.example.core+ has a corresponding test file at
_<project-root>/test/com/example/core_test.clj_ with namespace
+com.example.core-test+. To control the location of your source and
test directories and their inclusion on the JVM classpath, you should
use a build tool like link:http://leiningen.org/[Leiningen] or
link:http://maven.apache.org/[Maven] to organize your project.

In Leiningen, the default directory for your tests is a top-level
_<project-root>/test_ folder, and you can run your project's tests with
+lein test+ at the command line. Without any additional arguments, the
+lein test+ command will execute all of the tests in a project:

[source,text]
----
$ lein test

lein test com.example.core-test
lein test com.example.util-test

Ran 10 tests containing 20 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
----

To limit the scope of tests Leiningen runs, use the +:only+ option,
followed by a fully qualified namespace or function name:

[source,text]
----
# To run an entire namespace
$ lein test :only com.example.core-test

lein test com.example.core-test

Ran 5 tests containing 10 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.

# To run one specific test
$ lein test :only com.example.core-test/test-capitalize-entries

lein test com.example.core-test

Ran 1 tests containing 2 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
