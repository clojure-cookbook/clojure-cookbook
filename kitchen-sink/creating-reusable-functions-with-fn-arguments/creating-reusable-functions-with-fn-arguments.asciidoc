=== Make a Function Reusable by Passing a `fn` as an Argument

// By Chris Frisz (cjfrisz)

===== Problem

You want to reuse a single function in two different sections of your code, but
each caller needs that function to do something slightly different in one 
isolated part.

Consider the following (highly contrived) example:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn my-message-helper
  [msg]
  (str "super " msg)
  ;; make-awesome-message needs to prepend another string
  ;; make-cool-message needs to print to the screen
  )

(defn make-awesome-message []
  (my-message-helper "awesome"))

(defn make-cool-message []
  (my-message-helper "cool"))
----

===== Solution

Modify the `my-message-helper` function to take an extra argument 
(assumed to be a `fn`) and apply it to the value that needs the 
specific work.

[source, clojure]
----
(defn my-message-helper
  [msg extra-fn]
  (extra-fn (str "super " msg)))

(defn make-awesome-message []
  ; too few arguments to my-message-helper!
  ; you'll fix it in the next step
  (my-message-helper "awesome"))

(defn make-cool-message []
  ; too few arguments to my-message-helper!
  ; you'll fix it in the next step
  (my-message-helper "cool"))
----

Next, modify each caller to create a `fn` expression that does the specific 
piece of work to be done in `my-message-helper` and pass that as an argument.

[source, clojure]
----
(defn my-message-helper
  [msg extra-fn]
  (extra-fn (str "super " msg)))

(defn make-awesome-message []
  (my-message-helper "awesome" (partial str "really ")))

(defn make-cool-message []
  (my-message-helper "cool" #(do (prn %) %)))

(make-awesome-message)
;; -> "really super awesome"

(make-cool-message)
;; -> "super cool"
;; *out*
;; "super cool"
----

===== Discussion

Even though the two functions, `make-awesome-message` and `make-cool-message`,
did different work, the common work was reused in `my-message-helper`. 

The astute reader may notice that for this example one could simply `let`-bind 
the result of `my-message-helper` and do the work of the `extra-fn` within the
context of the two main functions: 

[source, clojure]
----
(defn my-message-helper
  [msg]
  (str "super " msg))

(defn make-awesome-message []
  (let [base-msg (my-message-helper "awesome")]
    (str "really " base-msg)))

(defn make-cool-message []
  (let [base-msg (my-message-helper "cool")]
    (do (prn base-msg) base-msg)))
----

Consider a slightly more complex example where the work done by `extra-fn` is 
buried in the middle of a larger computation. For example, consider if 
`my-message-helper` had originally appended another string to the end of the 
message:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn my-message-helper
  [msg]
  (str (str "super " msg) " times"))
----

In this case, you would have a harder time separating out the piece that needs
the caller-specific work done without splitting `my-message-helper` into two
functions: 

[source, clojure]
----
(defn my-message-helper1
  [msg]
  (str "super " msg))

(defn my-message-helper2
  [msg]
  (str msg " times"))

(defn make-awesome-message []
  (let [base-msg (my-message-helper1 "awesome")
        awesome-work (str "really " base-msg)]
    (my-message-helper2 awesome-work)))

(defn make-cool-message []
  (let [base-msg (my-message-helper1 "cool")]
    (prn base-msg)
    (my-message-helper2 base-msg)))
----

Since you would need to call both functions separately, but always 
together, you would create more opportunities for errors if you accidentally 
called one and not the other. This sort of artificial, error-prone 
separation is called a __bad abstraction__, and it highlights the 
benefits of the solution using functions as arguments.

As an alternative to the function argument, you could pass a flag to 
`my-message-helper` that tells it who called it, and perform the caller-
specific work based on the flag. That would look something like this:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn my-message-helper
  [msg caller-flag]
  (let [msg-base (str "super " msg)]
    (case caller-flag
      make-awesome-message (str "really " msg-base)
      make-cool-message    (do (prn msg-base) msg-base))))

(defn make-awesome-message []
  (my-message-helper "awesome" 'make-awesome-message))

(defn make-cool-message []
  (my-message-helper "cool" 'make-cool-message))
----

Consider if you wanted to add a new function, `make-rad-message`, that prepends
the string "mega " to the message:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn my-message-helper
  [msg caller-flag]
  (let [msg-base (str "super " msg)]
    (case caller-flag
      make-awesome-message (str "really " msg-base)
      make-cool-message    (do (prn msg-base) msg-base)
      make-rad-message     (str "mega " msg-base))))

(defn make-awesome-message []
  (my-message-helper "awesome" 'make-awesome-message))

(defn make-cool-message []
  (my-message-helper "cool" 'make-cool-message))

(defn make-rad-message []
  (my-message-helper "rad" 'make-rad-message))
----

Notice that you had to add the definition for `make-rad-message` __and__ modify 
the definition of `my-message-helper` to include a new `case` clause. Now 
consider if you used function arguments to `my-message-helper` as before:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn my-message-helper
  [msg extra-fn]
  (extra-fn (str "super " msg)))

(defn make-awesome-message []
  (my-message-helper "awesome" (partial str "really ")))

(defn make-cool-message []
  (my-message-helper "cool" #(do (prn %) %)))

(defn make-rad-message []
  (my-message-helper "rad" (partial str "mega ")))
----

In this example, you only needed to add the new definition for 
`make-rad-message` and made no modifications to `my-message-helper`. By using
a function argument instead of a flag, `my-message-helper` doesn't need to know
anything about the caller. In other words, you have "decoupled" 
`make-rad-message` from `my-message-helper`. 

As a related side note, you should always prefer solutions that decouple 
functions (or objects, data structures, etc.). As you can see from this 
example, decoupling leads to less code modification when adding new features, 
and therefore less chance for introducing errors.
