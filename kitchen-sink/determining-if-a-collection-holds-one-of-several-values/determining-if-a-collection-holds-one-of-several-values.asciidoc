=== Determining if a collection holds one of several values

// By John Touron (jwtouron)

==== Problem

You have a collection and want to determine if it holds one of several possible values.

==== Solution

Use +some+ along with a set.

[source,clojure]
----
(some #{1 2} (range 10))
;; -> 1

(some #{10} (range 10))
;; -> nil
----

==== Discussion

Since sets can act like functions, they can be used as predicates. This idiom will test each item in a collection, returning either the first match, or +nil+ if a match couldn't be found.

However, a problem arises when you search for +nil+ or +false+ in a collection. Consider the following:

[source,clojure]
----
(if (some #{nil} [nil])
  :match
  :no-match)
;; -> :no-match

(if (some #{false} [false])
  :match
  :no-match)
;; -> :no-match
----

The solution, in this case, is to use a map:

[source,clojure]
----
(if (some {nil true, false true} [nil false])
  :match
  :no-match)
;; -> :match
----
