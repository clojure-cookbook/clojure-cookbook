=== Conventions Used in This Book

==== Source Code

Clojure source code appears in monospaced font, like this:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns my-project.core)

(defn add
  [x y]
  (+ x y))
----

When a Clojure expression is evaluated for a return value, that value
is denoted with a comment followed by an arrow, like this:

[source,clojure]
----
(add 1 2)
;; -> 3
----

NOTE: Comments in Clojure start with a single semicolon. By
convention, comments with two semicolons explain the preceding
expression and are left-aligned to the same indentation
level. Comments with a single semicolon are typically used for the
right-hand margin, on the same line as the code being
commented. Three semicolons or more are used for top-level section and
file headers.

When an expression produces output, it is denoted by a comment
containing `*out*` followed by a comment with each line of output.

[source,clojure]
----
(do (println "Hello!") (println "Goodbye!"))
;; -> nil
;; *out*
;; Hello!
;; Goodbye!
----

==== REPL Sessions

REPLs (Read-Eval-Print Loop) are interactive prompts that evaluate
expressions and print the result. The Bash prompt, +irb+, and the
+python+ prompt are examples of REPLs.

A Clojure REPL session is denoted by a monospace font with a prompt
that includes the current namespace and a "+>+" symbol, indicating the
point where you should type your code. Output and return values appear
after the prompt.

// CONTRIBUTOR NOTE: there is currently no syntax highlighting for the
// Clojure REPL that I know of. Maybe somebody could write a lexer for
// Pygments?

----
user> (map str [4 5 6])
("4" "5" "6")
user> (println "Hello")
Hello
nil
user> 
----

==== Console/Terminal Sessions

Console sessions (e.g. shell commands) are denoted by monospace font,
with lines beginning with a dollar sign (+$+) indicating a shell
prompt. Output is printed without a leading "+$+".

A backslash (+\+) at the end of a command line indicates a single
command that continues on the next line.

[source,console]
