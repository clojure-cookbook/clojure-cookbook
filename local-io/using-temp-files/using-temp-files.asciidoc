=== Using temporary files from Clojure

==== Problem

You want to use a temporary file.

==== Solution

Use Java's +java.io.File/createTempFile+ to create a temporary file in the
default temporary-file directory of the JVM, with the provided prefix and
suffix.

[source,clojure]
----
(def my-temp-file (java.io.File/createTempFile "filename" ".txt"))
----

Write a line of text to the temporary file.

[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [file (clojure.java.io/writer my-temp-file)]
  (binding [*out* file] 
    (println "Example output.")))
----

==== Discussion

Temporary files are an excellent mechanism to provide, and retrieve, 
data from a subprocess which may not necessarily interact with Clojure 
or the JVM particularly well.

To get the full path and filename for the created temporary file.

[source,clojure]
----
(.getAbsolutePath my-temp-file)
----

Mark the temporary file to be deleted automatically when the JVM exits normally.

[source,clojure]
----
(.deleteOnExit my-temp-file)
----

Delete the temporary file immediately.

[source,clojure]
----
(.delete my-temp-file)
----

Create a temporary directory.

[source,clojure]
----
(def tmp-dir (doto (java.io.File/createTempFile "tmpdir" nil)
                   (.delete)
		   (.mkdir)))
----
