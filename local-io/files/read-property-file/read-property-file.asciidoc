==== Read property file

// By Tobias Bayer (codebrickie)

===== Problem

You need to read a property file and access its key-value pairs.

===== Solution

Propertea is a library that offers simple access to property files.

Given this property file you want to read from your Clojure code.

[source,clojure]
----
banana=yellow
grannysmith=green
----

Include propertea as a dependency for your project.

[source,clojure]
----
(defproject fruitcolors "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[propertea "1.2.3"]])
----

Read the property file and access its key-value pairs.

[source,clojure]
----
(use '[propertea.core])

(def props (read-properties "fruitcolors.properties"))

(props :banana)
;; -> "yellow"

(props :grannysmith)
;; -> "green"
----

===== Discussion
The basic +read-properties+ function treats all property values as strings. You can force parsing to other types by specifying the type for a property.

[source,clojure]
----
(def props (read-properties "fruitcolors.properties")
                            :parse-int [:intkey]
                            :parse-boolean [:booleankey])
----
