==== Get files from a directory

// By Stefan Karlsson (zclj)

===== Problem

You need to get the files from a directory.

===== Solution

Using +file-seq+ you will get a lazy sequence of +java.io.File+ objects.

[source,clojure]
----
(file-seq (clojure.java.io/file "./next-gen"))
;; -> (#<File ./next-gen> #<File ./next-gen/picard.jpg> #<File ./next-gen/locutus.bmp> #<File ./next-gen/data.txt>)
----

However it is a common scenario that you would want the file names rather than the actual file objects from the directory. You can achieve this by using the +.isFile+ and +.getName+ properties on a +java.io.File+ object. 
[source,clojure]
----
(defn get-file-names-from-directory [directory]
  (->> directory
       (clojure.java.io/file)
       (file-seq)
       (filter #(.isFile %))
       (map #(.getName %))))

(get-file-names-from-directory "./next-gen")
;; -> ("picard.jpg" "locutus.bmp" "data.txt")
----
This function take a path to a directory as its argument. From that path it will create a +file-seq+ and filter it on the +.isFile+ property to include only files. The last step is to get the name of all the +java.io.File+ objects that passed the filter. This is done by calling the +.getName+ property.

===== Discussion
You can achieve filtering on specific extensions with a regular expression. This example would filter on any files with a jpg, JPG or txt extension.
[source,clojure]
----
(filter #(re-find #"^.*\.(jpg|JPG|txt)$" %) (get-file-names-from-directory "./next-gen"))
;; -> ("picard.jpg" "data.txt")
----

You can make this more of a utility function and get the extensions and files as arguments. To do that a predicate to match against a vector of extensions is useful.
[source,clojure]
----
(defn has-file-extension? [file-name extensions]
  (let [extension-pattern (clojure.string/join "|" extensions)
        complete-pattern (str "^.+\\.(" extension-pattern ")$")
        extensions-reg-exp (re-pattern complete-pattern)]
    (if (re-find extensions-reg-exp file-name)
      true
      false)))

(has-file-extension? "picard.jpg" ["txt" "jpg"])
;; -> true

(has-file-extension? "locutus.bmp" ["txt" "jpg"])
;; -> false
----
The predicate will take a file name and a vector of extensions. It will join the extensions to build a string to insert into the regular expression ("jpg|JPG|txt", like in the example above). It will then check to see if the file name match the regular expression or not. Note that you have to use +re-pattern+ when building a regular expression from a string variable, the reader macro +#""+ will not work.

Armed with the predicate you can make a convenience function that performs the filtering. This function work on a vector of files and apply a filter with the predicate +has-file-extension?+ and the given extension on the sequence of files.
[source,clojure]
----
(defn filter-on-extensions [files extensions]
  (filter #(has-file-extension? % extensions) files))

(filter-on-extensions ["picard.jpg" "locutus.bmp"] ["txt" "jpg"])
;; -> ("picard.jpg")
----

Now you have all the parts to make a good looking utility function that get all the files from a directory with the given extensions.
[source,clojure]
----
(defn get-files-with-extension [directory extensions]
  (-> directory
      (get-file-names-from-directory)
      (filter-on-extensions extensions)))

(get-files-with-extension "./next-gen" ["txt" "jpg"])
;; -> ("picard.jpg" "data.txt")
----

Note that using +file-seq+ will give you a recursive tree from the given directory.

[source,clojure]
----
(file-seq (clojure.java.io/file "./next-gen"))
;; -> (#<File ./next-gen> #<File ./next-gen/picard.jpg> #<File ./next-gen/locutus.bmp> #<File ./next-gen/deep-space> #<File ./next-gen/deep-space/very-deep.org> #<File ./next-gen/data.txt>)
----

If that is not your intention, you can solve this by using a function that finds the depth of a file. The function will get the path of the file, split on the directory delimiter (use the directory delimiter of your file system) and do a count. The count is decreased by two to not count the own directory or the file name.
[source,clojure]
----
(defn get-file-directory-depth [file]
  (-> file
      (.getPath)
      (clojure.string/split #"\/")
      (count)
      (- 2)))
----

This function can now be used to filter on your required depth. The filter simply compares the depth of all files in the +file-seq+ and compares it to the depth that you require.
[source,clojure]
----
(filter #(= (get-file-directory-depth %) 1)  (file-seq (clojure.java.io/file "./next-gen")))
;; -> (#<File ./next-gen/picard.jpg> #<File ./next-gen/locutus.bmp> #<File ./next-gen/deep-space> #<File ./next-gen/data.txt>)
----

You can add this functionality to the +get-file-names-from-directory+ function. You do this by adding an argument that specifies the required depth and then include the filter created above.
[source,clojure]
----
(defn get-file-names-from-directory-with-depth [directory depth]
  (->> directory
       (clojure.java.io/file)
       (file-seq)
       (filter #(.isFile %))
       (filter #(= (get-file-directory-depth %) depth))
       (map #(.getName %))))

(get-file-names-from-directory-with-depth "./next-gen" 2)
;; -> ("very-deep.org")
