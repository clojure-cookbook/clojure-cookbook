////

===== Problem

You want to write to stdout and stderr.

===== Solution

To stdout,

[source,clojure]
----
(println "This text will be printed to stdout.")
----

To stderr,

[source,clojure]
----
(binding [*out* *err*]
  (println "This text will be printed to stderr."))
----

===== Discussion

In Clojure `*in*`, `*out*`, and `*err*` are bound to stdin, stdout, and stderr.
Using the +binding+ function all output normally sent to stdout can be sent to
stderr; or using +clojure.java.io/writer+, to the file of your choice.
