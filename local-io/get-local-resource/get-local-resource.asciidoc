==== Package a local file with your program, and access it

===== Problem

You want access to some data stored locally with your code.

===== Solution

Put your file(s) in +resources/+ located in the top level of your project.
Use http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.java.io/resource[+clojure.java.io/resource+] 
to read it.

For example, say you have a file +resources/people.edn+:

[source,clojure]
----
[{:first-name "John", :last-name "McCarthy", :language "Lisp"}
 {:first-name "Guido", :last-name "Van Rossum", :language "Python"}
 {:first-name "Rich", :last-name "Hickey", :language "Clojure"}]
----

Then the following will read and process that file:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns process-people
  (:use [clojure.java.io :only [resource]]))

(println (->> "people.edn"
              resource
              slurp
              read-string
              (map :language)))

;=> (Lisp Python Clojure)

===== Discussion

Resources are loaded via the classpath. Leiningen puts the
+resources/+ directory on the classpath; when packaged, the contents
of +resources/+ are copied to the root of the JAR. Data packaged this
way will therefore continue to be available to your code after your
JAR file is distributed.
