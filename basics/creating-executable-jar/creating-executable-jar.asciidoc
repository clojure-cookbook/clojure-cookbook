=== Create an executable jar file
[role="byline"]
by Alan Busby

==== Problem

You want to create an executable jar.

==== Solution

Using +Leiningen+ to create an "uberjar" (See the "Using Leiningen"
recipe for instructions on obtaining and installing Leiningen)

Add a +:main+ and +:aot+ parameter to your +project.clj+.

[source,clojure]
----
(defproject foo "1.0.0"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.5.1"]]
  :main foo.core
  :aot :all)
----

Add a +(:gen-class)+ parameter to the namespace listed as +:main+ in your +project.clj+ file.

[source,clojure]
----
(ns foo.core
  (:gen-class))
----

Add a +-main+ function to the namespace.

[source,clojure]
----
(defn -main [& args]
  (->> args
       (interpose "\n")
       (apply str)
       (println "Executed with the following args;\n")))
----

At the command line, call +lein uberjar+ to have Leiningen build an executable jar file.

[source,bash]
----
$ lein uberjar
Created /tmp/foo/target/uberjar/foo-1.0.0.jar
Created /tmp/foo/target/foo-1.0.0-standalone.jar
----

Then, you can execute the jar along with whatever parameters you'd like to provide.

[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar target/foo-1.0.0-standalone.jar 1 2 3 4
Executed with the following args;
 1
2
3
4
----

==== Discussion

Executable jar files provide an excellent method to package a program
so it can be provided to users, called by cronjobs, combined with
other UNIX tools, or used in any other scenario where command-line
invocation is useful.

Under the hood, an executable jar is like any other jar file in that
it contains a collection of program resources such as class files,
Clojure source files, classpath resources, etc. Additionally,
executable jars contain metadata indicating which class contains the
+main+ method as a +Main-Class+ tag in its internal manifest file.

A Leiningen uberjar is a jar file that contains not only your program,
but all the dependencies bundled in as well. When Leiningen builds an
uberjar, it can detect from the +:main+ entry in +project.clj+ that
your program supplies a +main+ function, and writes an appropriate
manifest that will ensure that the emitted jar file is executable.

The +:gen-class+ in your namespace, and the +:aot+ Leiningen option
are required to precompile your Clojure source file into a JVM class
file, since the "Main-Class" manifest entry doesn't know how to
reference or compile Clojure source files.
