===== Problem

You want to create an executable jar.

===== Solution

Using +Leiningen+ to create an "uberjar", https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

Add a +:main+ and +:aot+ parameter to your +project.clj+.

[source,clojure]
----
(defproject foo "1.0.0"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.5.1"]]
  :main foo.core
  :aot :all)
----

Add a +(:gen-class)+ parameter to the namespace listed as +:main+ in your +project.clj+ file.

[source,clojure]
----
(ns foo.core
  (:gen-class))
----

Add a +-main+ function to the namespace. 

[source,clojure]
----
(defn -main [& args]
  (->> args
       (interpose "\n")
       (apply str)
       (println "Executed with the following args;\n")))
----

Call +lein uberjar+ to have Leiningen build an executable jar file.

[source,bash]
----
$ lein uberjar
Created /tmp/foo/target/uberjar/foo-1.0.0.jar
Created /tmp/foo/target/foo-1.0.0-standalone.jar
----

Then execute the jar along with whatever parameters you'd like to provide.

[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar target/foo-1.0.0-standalone.jar 1 2 3 4
Executed with the following args;
 1
2
3
4
----

===== Discussion

Executable jar files provide an excellent method to package a program so
it can be provided to users, called by cronjobs, or combined with other
UNIX tools.
