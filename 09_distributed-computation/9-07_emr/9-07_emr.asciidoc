=== Running a Cascalog Job on Elastic MapReduce
[role="byline"]
by Alex Robbins

==== Problem

You have a large amount of data to process, but you don't have a
Hadoop cluster.

==== Solution

Amazon's Elastic MapReduce (EMR) provides on-demand Hadoop clusters.
You'll need http://aws.amazon.com/[an Amazon Web Services account] to use EMR.

First, write a Cascalog job as you normally would. There are a number
of recipes in this chapter that can help you create a complete
Cascalog job. If you don't have your own, you can clone
<<sec_cascalog_etl>>:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/clojure-cookbook/cascalog-samples.git
$ cd cascalog-samples
$ git checkout etl-sample
----

Once you have a Cascalog project, package it into an uberjar:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ lein compile
$ lein uberjar
----

Next, upload the generated JAR
(_target/cookbook-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar_ if you're
following along with the ETL sample) to S3. If you
haven't ever uploaded a file to S3, follow the S3 documentation to
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html["Create
a Bucket"] and
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/PuttingAnObjectInABucket.html["Adding
an Object to a Bucket"]. Repeat this process to upload your input data.
Take note of the path of the JAR and input data location.

To create your MapReduce job, visit
https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/ and select "Create
New Job Flow" (<<fig9-2>>). Once you're in the new job flow wizard, choose the
"Custom JAR" job type.

Select "Continue" and enter your JAR's location and arguments. "JAR
Location" is the S3 path you noted from earlier. "JAR Arguments" are
all of the arguments you would normally pass when executing your JAR.
For example, using the Cascalog samples repository, the arguments
would be the fully qualified class name to execute,
+cookbook.etl.Main+, an +s3n://+ URI for input data, and an +s3n://+
URI for the output.

The next few wizard windows allow your to specify additional
configuration options for the job. Select "Continue" until you reach
the review phase and start your job.

After your job has run, you should be able to retrieve the results
from S3. Elastic MapReduce also allows you to setup a logging path to
help with debugging if your job doesn't complete like you expect.

==== Discussion

Amazon's EMR is a great solution if you have big Cascalog jobs but
you don't have them very often. Maintaining your own Hadoop cluster
can be a fair amount of time and money. If you can keep the cluster
busy, it is a great investment. If you only need it a couple times a
month, you might be better off using EMR for on-demand Hadoop
clusters.(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_DCcasc")))
