=== Building an Activity Feed System with Storm
[role="byline"]
by Travis Vachon

==== Problem

You want to build an activity stream processing system to filter and aggregate the raw event data generated by the users of your application. 

==== Solution

Streams are a dominant metaphor for presenting information to users of
the modern Internet. Used on sites like Facebook and Twitter and mobile
apps like Instagram and Tinder, streams are an elegant tool for giving
users a window into the deluge of information generated by the
applications they use every day.(((distributed computation, activity feed systems)))(((streaming)))

As a developer of these applications, you want tools to process the
firehose of raw event data generated by user actions. They must offer
powerful capabilities for filtering and aggregating data and must be
arbitrarily scalable to serve ever-growing user bases. Ideally
they should provide high-level abstractions that help you organize and
grow the complexity of your stream-processing logic to accommodate new
features and a complex world.(((userbases)))(((realtime computation systems)))(((activity stream processing)))

Clojure offers just such a tool in http://storm-project.net/[Storm], a
distributed real-time computation system that aims to be for real-time
computation what Hadoop is for batch computation. In this section,
you'll build a simple activity stream processing system that can be
easily extended to solve real-world problems.(((Storm, project creation/setup)))

First, create a new http://storm.incubator.apache.org/[Storm project] using its Leiningen template:

[source,text]
----
$ lein new cookbook-storm-project feeds
----

In the project directory, run the default Storm topology (which the
+lein+ template has generated for you):

[source,text]
----
$ cd feeds
$ lein run -m feeds.topology/run!
Compiling feeds.TopologySubmitter
...
Emitting: spout default [:bizarro]
Processing received message source: spout:4, stream: default, id: {}, [:bizarro]
Emitting: stormy-bolt default ["I'm bizarro Stormy!"]
Processing received message source: stormy-bolt:5,
  stream: default, id: {}, [I'm bizarro Stormy!]
Emitting: feeds-bolt default ["feeds produced: I'm bizarro Stormy!"]
----

This generated example topology just babbles example messages
incoherently, which probably isn't what you want, so begin by
modifying the "spout" to produce realistic events. 

In Storm parlance,
the "spout" is the component that inserts data into the processing system
and creates a data stream. Open _src/feeds/spouts.clj_ and replace the
+defspout+ form with a new spout that will periodically produce random
user events such as one might see in an online marketplace (in a real
application, of course, you'd hook this up to some source of real
data rather than a random data generator):

[source,clojure]
----
(defspout event-spout ["event"]
  [conf context collector]
  (let [events [{:action :commented, :user :travis, :listing :red-shoes}
                {:action :liked, :user :jim, :listing :red-shoes}
                {:action :liked, :user :karen, :listing :green-hat}
                {:action :liked, :user :rob, :listing :green-hat}
                {:action :commented, :user :emma, :listing :green-hat}]]
    (spout
     (nextTuple []
       (Thread/sleep 1000)
       (emit-spout! collector [(rand-nth events)])))))
----

Next, open _src/feeds/bolts.clj_. Add a bolt that accepts a user and
an event and produces a tuple of +(user, event)+ for each user in the
system. A bolt consumes a stream, does some processing, and emits a
new stream:

[source,clojure]
----
(defbolt active-user-bolt ["user" "event"] [{event "event" :as tuple} collector] 
  (doseq [user [:jim :rob :karen :kaitlyn :emma :travis]]
    (emit-bolt! collector [user event]))
  (ack! collector tuple))
----

Now add a bolt that accepts a user and an event and emits a tuple if
and only if the user is following the user who triggered the event:

[source,clojure]
----
(defbolt follow-bolt ["user" "event"] {:prepare true}
  [conf context collector]
  (let [follows {:jim #{:rob :emma}
                 :rob #{:karen :kaitlyn :jim}
                 :karen #{:kaitlyn :emma}
                 :kaitlyn #{:jim :rob :karen :kaitlyn :emma :travis}
                 :emma #{:karen}
                 :travis #{:kaitlyn :emma :karen :rob}}]
    (bolt
     (execute [{user "user" event "event" :as tuple}]
              (when ((follows user) (:user event))
                (emit-bolt! collector [user event]))
              (ack! collector tuple)))))
----

Finally, add a bolt that accepts a user and an event and stores the event
in a hash of sets like +{:user1 #{event1 event2} :user2 #{event1 event2}}+&#x2014;these are the activity streams you'll present to users:

[source,clojure]
----
(defbolt feed-bolt ["user" "event"] {:prepare true}
  [conf context collector]
  (let [feeds (atom {})]
    (bolt
     (execute [{user "user" event "event" :as tuple}]
              (swap! feeds #(update-in % [user] conj event))
              (println "Current feeds:")
              (clojure.pprint/pprint @feeds)
              (ack! collector tuple)))))
----

This gives you all the pieces you'll need, but you'll still need
to assemble them into a computational topology. Open up
_src/feeds/topology.clj_ and use the topology DSL to wire the spouts
and bolts together:

[source,clojure]
----
(defn storm-topology []
  (topology
   {"events" (spout-spec event-spout)}

   {"active users" (bolt-spec {"events" :shuffle} active-user-bolt :p 2)
    "follows" (bolt-spec {"active users" :shuffle} follow-bolt :p 2)
    "feeds" (bolt-spec {"follows" ["user"]} feed-bolt :p 2)}))
----

You'll also need to update the +:require+ statement in that file:

[source,clojure]
----
  (:require [feeds
             [spouts :refer [event-spout]]
             [bolts :refer [active-user-bolt follow-bolt feed-bolt]]]
            [backtype.storm [clojure :refer [topology spout-spec bolt-spec]]
                            [config :refer :all]])
----

Run the topology again. Feeds will be printed to the console by the
final bolts in the topology:

[source,text]
$ lein run -m feeds.topology/run!

==== Discussion

Storm's Clojure DSL doesn't look like standard Clojure.(((Storm, core primitives in))) Instead, it
uses Clojure's macros to extend the language to the domain of stream
processing. Storm's stream processing abstraction consists of four core
primitives:

Tuples::
Allow programmers to provide names for values. Tuples are dynamically typed lists of values.(((tuples)))

Spouts::
Produce tuples, often by reading from a distributed
   queue.(((spouts)))

Bolts::
Accept tuples as input and produce new tuples--these
   are the core computational units of a Storm topology.(((bolts)))

Streams::
Used to wire spouts to bolts and bolts to other bolts,
   creating a computational topology. Streams can be configured with
   rules for routing certain types of tuples to specific instances of
   bolts.(((streams)))

The following subsections review the components of our system to give a
better picture of how these primitives work together.

===== event-spout

+defspout+ looks much like Clojure's standard +defn+, with one(((Storm, event-spout)))
difference--the second argument to +defspout+ is a list of names that
will be assigned to elements of each tuple this spout produces. This
lets you use tuples like vectors or maps interchangeably. The third
argument to +defspout+ is a list of arguments that will be bound
various components of Storm's operational infrastructure. 

In the case of the +event-spout+ spout, only +collector+ is used:

[source,clojure]
----
(defspout event-spout ["event"]
  [conf context collector]
----

++defspout++'s body will be evaluated once, when the spout instance is
created, which gives you an opportunity to create in-memory state. Usually this will be a connection to a database or distributed queue, but in this case you'll create a list of events this spout will produce:

[source,clojure]
----
  (let [events [{:action :commented, :user :travis, :listing :red-shoes}
                {:action :liked, :user :jim, :listing :red-shoes}
                {:action :liked, :user :karen, :listing :green-hat}
                {:action :liked, :user :rob, :listing :green-hat}
                {:action :commented, :user :emma, :listing :green-hat}]]
----

This call to +spout+ creates an instance of a spout with the given
implementation of +nextTuple+. This implementation simply sleeps for
one second and then uses +emit-spout!+ to emit a one-element tuple
consisting of a random event from the preceding list: 

[source,clojure]
----
    (spout
     (nextTuple []
       (Thread/sleep 1000)
       (emit-spout! collector [(rand-nth events)])))))
----

+nextTuple+ will be
called repeatedly in a tight loop, so if you create a spout that polls
an external resource, you may need to provide your own backoff
algorithm to avoid excess load on that resource.

You can also implement the spout's +ack+ method to implement a
"reliable" spout that will provide message-processing guarantees. For
more information on reliable spouts, see Storm's spout implementation
for the Kestrel queueing system, https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm-kestrel[+storm-kestrel+].

===== active-user-bolt

Every time a user takes an action in this system, the system needs to determine(((Storm, active-user-bolt)))
whether each other user in the system will be interested in it. Given
a simple interest system like Twitter, where users express interest in
a single way (i.e., user follows), you could simply look at the
follower list of the user who took the action and update feeds
accordingly. In a more complex system, however, interest might be
expressed by having liked the item the action was taken against,
following a collection that the item has been added to, or following
the seller of the item. In this world, you need to consider a variety
of factors for each user in the system for every event and determine
whether the event should be added to that user's feed.

The first bolt starts this process by generating a tuple of +(user,
event)+ for each user in the system every time an event is generated
by the +event-spout+:

[source,clojure]
----
(defbolt active-user-bolt ["user" "event"] [{event "event" :as tuple} collector]
  (doseq [user [:jim :rob :karen :kaitlyn :emma :travis]]
    (emit-bolt! collector [user event]))
  (ack! collector tuple))
----

++defbolt++'s signature looks very similar to +defspout+. The second
argument is a list of names that will be assigned to tuples generated
by this bolt, and the third argument is a list of parameters. The
first parameter will be bound to the input tuple, and may be
destructured as a map or a vector.

The body of this bolt iterates through a list of users in the system
and emits a tuple for each of them. The last line of the body calls +ack!+
on this tuple, which allows Storm to track message processing and restart
processing when appropriate.

===== follow-bolt

The next bolt is a _prepared bolt_; that is, one that maintains(((Storm, follow-bolt)))
in-memory state. In many cases, this would mean maintaining a
connection to a database or a queue, or a data structure aggregating
some aspect of the tuples it processes, but this example maintains a
complete list of the followers in the system in memory.

This bolt looks more like the spout definition. The second argument
is a list of names, the third argument is a map of bolt configuration
options (importantly, these set +:prepare+ to +true+), and the fourth
argument is the same set of operational arguments received in
+defspout+:

[source,clojure]
----
(defbolt follow-bolt ["user" "event"] {:prepare true}
  [conf context collector]
----

The body of the bolt first defines the list of followers, and then
provides the actual bolt definition inside a call to +bolt+:

[source,clojure]
----
  (let [follows {:jim #{:rob :emma}
                 :rob #{:karen :kaitlyn :jim}
                 :karen #{:kaitlyn :emma}
                 :kaitlyn #{:jim :rob :karen :kaitlyn :emma :travis}
                 :emma #{:karen}
                 :travis #{:kaitlyn :emma :karen :rob}}]
    (bolt
     (execute [{user "user" event "event" :as tuple}]
              (when ((follows user) (:user event))
                (emit-bolt! collector [user event]))
              (ack! collector tuple)))))
----

Note that the tuple argument is inside the bolt's definition of
+execute+ in this case and may be destructured as usual. In cases
where the event's user is not following the user in the tuple, it does
not emit a new tuple and simply acknowledges that it received the
input.

As noted earlier, this particular system could be implemented much
more simply by querying whatever datastore tracks follows and simply
adding a story to the feed of each follower. Anticipating a more
complicated system, however, provides a massively extensible
architecture. This bolt could easily be expanded to a collection of
scoring bolts, each of which would evaluate a user/event pair based on
its own criteria and emit a tuple of (+user+, +event+, +score+). A
score aggregation bolt would receive scores from each scoring bolt and
choose to emit a tuple once it received scores from each type of
scoring bolt in the system. In this world, adjusting the factors
determining the makeup of a user's feed and their relative weights
would be trivial--indeed, production experience with just such a
system was, in the opinion of the authors, delightful (see the
https://github.com/utahstreetlabs/risingtide[Rising Tide project page] on GitHub).

===== feed-bolt

The final bolt aggregates events into feeds. Since it only receives(((Storm, feed-bolt)))
(+user+, +event+) tuples that the "scoring system" has approved, it
needs only add the event to the existing list of events it has
received for the given user:

[source,clojure]
----
  (let [feeds (atom {})]
    (bolt
     (execute [{user "user" event "event" :as tuple}]
              (swap! feeds #(update-in % [user] conj event))
              (println "Current feeds:")
              (clojure.pprint/pprint @feeds)
              (ack! collector tuple))))
----

This toy topology simply prints the current feeds every time it
receives a new event, but in the real world it would persist feeds to
a durable datastore or a cache that could efficiently serve the feeds
to users.

Note that this design can be easily extended to support event
digesting; rather than storing each event separately, it could
aggregate an incoming event with other similar events for the user's
convenience.

As described, this system has one enormous flaw: by default,
Storm tuples are delivered to exactly one instance of each bolt, and
the number of instances in existence is not defined in the bolt
implementation. If the topology operator adds more than one
+feed-bolt+, we may have events for the same user delivered to
different bolt instances, giving each bolt a different feed for the
same user.

Happily, this flaw is addressed by Storm's support for _stream
grouping_, which is defined in the Storm topology definition.

===== Topology

The topology definition is where the rubber meets the road. Spouts are(((Storm, topology definition)))
wired to bolts, which are wired to other bolts, and the flow of tuples
between them can be configured to give useful properties to the
computation. 

This is also where you define the component-level
parallelism of the topology, which provides a rough sketch of the true
operational parallelism of the system.

A topology definition consists of spout specifications and bolt
specifications, each of which is a map from names to specifications.

Spout specifications simply give a name to a spout implementation:

[source,clojure]
----
   {"events" (spout-spec event-spout)}
----

Multiple spouts can be configured, and the specification may define
the parallelism of the spout:

[source,clojure]
----
   {
     "events" (spout-spec event-spout)
     "parallel-spout" (spout-spec a-different-more-parallel-spout :p 2)
   }
----

This definition means the topology will have one instance of
+event-spout+ and two instances of +a-different-more-parallel-spout+.

Bolt definitions get a bit more complicated:

[source,clojure]
----
    "active users" (bolt-spec {"events" :shuffle} active-user-bolt :p 2)
    "follows" (bolt-spec {"active users" :shuffle} follow-bolt :p 2)
----

As with the spout spec, you must provide a name for the bolt and
specify its parallelism. In addition, bolts require specifying a
_stream grouping_, which defines (a) from which component the bolt
receives tuples and (b) how the system chooses which in-memory
instance of the bolt to send tuples to. Both of these cases specify
+:shuffle+, which means tuples from "events" will be sent to a random
instance of +active-user-bolt+, and tuples from "active users" will be
sent to a random instance of +follow-bolt+.

As noted, +feed-bolt+ needs to be more careful:

[source,clojure]
----
    "feeds" (bolt-spec {"follows" ["user"]} feed-bolt :p 2)
----

This bolt spec specifies a _fields grouping_ on "user". This means
that all tuples with the same "user" value will be sent to the
same instance of +feed-bolt+. This stream grouping is configured with
a list of field names, so field groupings may consider the equality
of multiple field values when determining which bolt instance should
process a given tuple.

Storm also supports stream groupings that send tuples to all instances
and groupings that let the bolt producing a tuple determine where to
send it. Combined with the groupings already seen, these provide an
enormous amount of flexibility in determining how data flows through
your topology.

Each of these component specifications supports a parallelism option.
Because the topology does not specify the physical hardware upon which
it will run, these hints cannot be used to determine the true
parallelism of the system, but they are used by the cluster to
determine how many in-memory instances of the specified components to
create.

===== Deployment

The real magic of Storm comes out in deployment. Storm gives you the(((Storm, deployment)))
tools to build small, independent components that make no
assumptions about how many identical instances are running in the same
topology. This means that the topology itself is essentially
infinitely scalable. The edges of the system, which receive data
from and send data to external components like queues and databases, are
not necessarily as scalable, but in many cases, strategies for scaling
these services are well understood.

A simple deployment strategy is built into the Storm library:

[source,clojure]
----
  (doto (LocalCluster.)
    (.submitTopology "my first topology"
                     {TOPOLOGY-DEBUG (Boolean/parseBoolean debug)
                      TOPOLOGY-WORKERS (Integer/parseInt workers)}
                     (storm-topology)))
----

+LocalCluster+ is an in-memory implementation of a Storm cluster. You can
specify the number of _workers_ it will use to execute the
components of your topology and submit the topology itself, at which
point it begins polling the +nextTuple+ methods of the topology's
spouts. As spouts emit tuples, they are propagated through the system
to complete the topology's computation.

Submitting the topology to a configured cluster is nearly as simple,
as you can see in _src/feeds/TopologySubmitter.clj_:

[source,clojure]
----
(defn -main [& {debug "debug" workers "workers" :or {debug "false" workers "4"}}]
  (StormSubmitter/submitTopology
   "feeds topology"
   {TOPOLOGY-DEBUG (Boolean/parseBoolean debug)
    TOPOLOGY-WORKERS (Integer/parseInt workers)}
   (storm-topology)))
----

This file uses Clojure's Java interop to generate a Java class with a
+main+ method. Because the _project.clj_ file specifies that this file
should be ahead-of-time compiled, when you use +lein uberjar+ to build
a JAR suitable for submission to the cluster, this file will be
compiled to look like a normal Java class file. You can upload this JAR
to the machine running Storm's _Nimbus_ daemon and submit it for
execution using the +storm+ command:

[source,text]
----
$ storm jar path/to/thejariuploaded.jar feeds.TopologySubmitter "workers" 5
----

This command will tell the cluster to allocate five dedicated workers for
this topology and begin polling +nextTuple+ on all of its spouts, as
it did when you used +LocalCluster+. A cluster may run any number of
topologies simultaneously--each worker is a physical JVM and may end
up running instances of many different bolts and spouts.

The full details of setting up and running a Storm cluster are out of
the scope of this recipe, but they are documented extensively on
Storm's wiki.

===== Conclusion

We've only touched on a fraction of the functionality Storm has to
offer. Built-in distributed remote procedure calls allow users to
harness the power of a Storm cluster to make synchronous requests
that trigger a flurry of activity across hundreds or thousands of
machines. Guaranteed data-processing semantics allow users to build
extremely robust systems. Trident, a higher-level abstraction over
Storm's primitives, provides breathtakingly simple solutions to
complicated real-time computing problems. A detailed runtime console
provides crucial insight into the runtime characteristics of a fully
operational Storm cluster. The power provided by this system is truly
remarkable.(((Storm, benefits of)))

Storm is also a fantastic example of Clojure's ability to be extended
to a problem domain. Its constructs idiomatically extend Clojure
syntax and allow the programmer to stay within the domain of real-time
processing, without needing to deal with low-level language
formalities. This allows Storm to truly get out of the way. The
majority of the code in a well-written Storm topology's code base is
focused on the problem at hand. The result is concise, maintainable
code and happy programmers.
