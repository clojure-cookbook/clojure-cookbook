==== Creating Strings

// By John Cromartie (jcromartie)

===== Problem

You need to create a string by concatenating several values together.

===== Solution

Use +str+ to combine arguments into a single string.

----
(str)
;; -> ""

(str "example" 1 2 3)
;; -> "example123"

(apply str (range 10))
;; -> "0123456789"
----

===== Discussion

+str+ is one of the most crucial core functions in Clojure, because
let's face it: when it all comes down do it, programming is all about
turning strings of data into other strings of data.

The underlying Java +.toString()+ method is called on each argument to
+str+ in order to build the result.

Concatenating a large number of values is most efficient when you can
pass them as arguments to +str+ all at once.
