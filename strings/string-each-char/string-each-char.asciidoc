==== Enumerating Each Character in a String

// By John Cromartie (jcromartie)

===== Problem

You need to treat each character in a String separately.

===== Solution

A seq on a String returns a sequence of its characters. All of
Clojure's seq functions can operate on Strings.

[source,clojure]
----
(seq "asdf")
;; -> (\a \s \d \f)

(filter #(Character/isUpperCase %) "This Is A Test")
;; -> (\T \I \A \T)
----

===== Discussion

In addition to other collection types, +seq+ coerces Strings into
Clojure seqs. All of clojure's functions which operate on seqs call
+seq+ on their arguments first, so you can pass Strings directly to
+distinct+, +filter+, +take+, etc., to operate on the characters in a
string.
