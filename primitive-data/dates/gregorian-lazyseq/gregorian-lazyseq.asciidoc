==== Generate an Infinite Lazy Sequence of Gregorian Calendar Dates

===== Problem

You would like to generate a lazy sequence of Gregorian calendar dates (or
times) beginning on a specific date and time.

===== Solution

You can use Java's +java.util.GregorianCalendar+ class coupled with
Clojure's +repeatedly+ function to generate a lazy sequence of Gregorian
calendar dates. You can then use +java.text.SimpleDateFormat+ to format the
dates, with a huge variety of output formats available.

This example creates an infinite lazy sequence of Gregorian calendar dates
beginning on January 1, 1970 and each spanning a single day. The core +take+
and +drop+ functions are then used to select the last two days of February.
(Be careful not to evaluate the infinite sequence itself in the REPL).

[source,clojure]
----
(def daily-from-epoch
  (let [ start-date (java.util.GregorianCalendar. 1970 0 0 0 0) ]
    (repeatedly
      (fn []
        (.add start-date java.util.Calendar/DAY_OF_YEAR 1)
        (.clone start-date) ))))

(take 2 (drop 57 daily-from-epoch))
;; -> (#inst "1970-02-27T00:00:00.000-07:00" #inst "1970-02-28T00:00:00.000-07:00")

===== Discussion

Clojure has no date type of its own but, by default, relies on its
ability to easily interoperate with Java (but see the +clj-time+ library
for alternatives to Java's date, time, and calendar classes).

This solution is based on the core +repeatedly+ function, which creates a lazy
sequence by repeatedly calling the argument function it is given and returning
a sequence of the function's results. Because we do not provide the optional,
limiting argument to +repeatedly+, the result sequences produced are
infinite. Consequently, in the REPL environment, we must be careful to evaluate
our result sequences in contexts (such as +take+ and +drop+) which
limit the values produced.

Since the function given to +repeatedly+ is a function of no arguments, it is
presumed to achieve its goals by side-effects (making it an impure function).
Here, the impurity occurs as the argument function creates a Gregorian calendar
date and repeatedly increments it by a single +java.util.Calendar+ day
unit. For each call of the function we return a copy of the Gregorian calendar
object (to avoid mysterious and unintended side-effects, it is advisable to
avoid returning the mutated object directly).

The date values in the result sequence are of type
+java.util.GregorianCalendar+ but the +print+ function of the REPL displays
them as an +#inst+ reader literal. We can verify that the sequence elements
are Gregorian calenders by mapping the +class+ (or +type+) function onto the
sequence:

[source,clojure]
----
(def end-of-feb (take 2 (drop 57 daily-from-epoch)))
(map class end-of-feb)
;; -> (java.util.GregorianCalendar java.util.GregorianCalendar)
----

We can generalize the solution to a function which takes a starting year
argument but defaults to some convenient year if the argument is not provided:

[source,clojure]
----
(defn daily-from-year [& [start-year]]
  (let [ start-date (java.util.GregorianCalendar. (or start-year 1970) 0 0 0 0) ]
    (repeatedly
      (fn []
        (.add start-date java.util.Calendar/DAY_OF_YEAR 1)
        (.clone start-date) ))))

(take 3 (daily-from-year 1999))
;; -> (#inst "1999-01-01T00:00:00.000-07:00"
;;     #inst "1999-01-02T00:00:00.000-07:00"
;;     #inst "1999-01-03T00:00:00.000-07:00")

(take 2 (daily-from-year))
;; -> (#inst "1970-01-01T00:00:00.000-07:00" #inst "1970-01-02T00:00:00.000-07:00")
----


Using the +java.text.SimpleDateFormat+ class we can then format the dates in a
wide variety of different formats, two of which are illustrated:

[source,clojure]
----
(def end-of-days (take 3 (drop 353 (daily-from-year 2012))))
(def cal-format (java.text.SimpleDateFormat. "EEE M/d/yyyy"))
(def iso8601-format (java.text.SimpleDateFormat. "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'"))

(map #(.format cal-format (.getTime %)) end-of-days)
;; -> ("Wed 12/19/2012" "Thu 12/20/2012" "Fri 12/21/2012")

(map #(.format iso8601-format (.getTime %)) end-of-days)
;; -> ("2012-12-19T00:00:00Z" "2012-12-20T00:00:00Z" "2012-12-21T00:00:00Z")
----


Finally, putting it all together, we can create a function which generates an
infinite lazy sequence of formatted Gregorian date strings. For convenience,
the function takes optional starting year and date format string arguments:

[source,clojure]
----
(defn gregorian-day-seq
  "Return an infinite sequence of formatted Gregorian day strings starting on January 1st of the given year (default 1970)"
  [& [start-year date-format]]
  (let [ gd-format (java.text.SimpleDateFormat. (or date-format "EEE M/d/yyyy"))
         start-date (java.util.GregorianCalendar. (or start-year 1970) 0 0 0 0) ]
    (repeatedly
      (fn []
        (.add start-date java.util.Calendar/DAY_OF_YEAR 1)
        (.format gd-format (.getTime start-date)) ))))
----


To test our function, we find all the Sundays in a sequence of day strings for
the year 2000 and then select the last Sunday of that year:

[source,clojure]
----
(def y2k (take 366 (gregorian-day-seq 2000)))
(last (filter #(.startsWith % "Sun") y2k))
;; -> "Sun 12/31/2000"
----
