=== Obtaining the Current Date and Time

===== Problem

You need to obtain the current date or time.

===== Solution

Use Java's +java.util.Date+ constructor to create a +Date+ instance
representing the present time and date.

[source,clojure]
----
(defn now []
  (java.util.Date.))

(now)
;; -> #inst "2013-04-06T14:33:45.740-00:00"

;; A few seconds later...
(now)
;; -> #inst "2013-04-06T14:33:51.234-00:00"
----

If you're more interested in the current Unix timestamp, use
+System/currentTimeMillis+.

[source,clojure]
----
(System/currentTimeMillis)
;; -> 1365260110635

(System/currentTimeMillis)
;; -> 1365260157013
----

===== Discussion

It doesn't make much sense for Clojure to re-implement or wrap the
JVM's backing time and date functionality. As such the norm is to use
Clojure's Java interop forms to instantiate a +Date+ object
representing "now."

+#inst "2013-04-06T14:33:51.234-00:00"+ doesn't look very much like
Java now, does it? That's because Clojure's "instant" reader literal
uses +java.util.Date+ as its backing implementation. You can learn
more about the +#inst+ reader literal in <<sec_primitives_dates_reader_literal>>

Using +System/currentTimeMillis+ can be useful for performing a
one-off benchmark, but given the high quality tools out there that do
this already +currentTimeMillis+ is of limited utility; you may want
to try Hugo Duncan's
https://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium[criterium] library if
benchmarking is what you're after. Additionally, you shouldn't try to
use +currentTimeMillis+ as some sort of unique value - UUIDs do
a much better job of this.

If you decide you would rather use
https://github.com/clj-time/clj-time[clj-time] to work with dates, it
provides the a function +clj-time.core/now+ to get the current +DateTime+.

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clj-time.core :as timec])

(timec/now)
;; -> #<DateTime 2013-04-06T14:35:15.453Z>
----

Use +clj-time.local/local-now+ to retrieve a +DateTime+ instance for
the present scoped to your machine's local time zone.

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clj-time.local :as timel])

(timel/local-now)
;; -> #<DateTime 2013-04-06T09:35:20.141-05:00>
