==== Converting Strings to numbers

// By Stefan Karlsson (zclj)

===== Problem

You need to convert strings to numbers.

===== Solution

Using +read-string+ to convert a string to a number is very straight forward.

[source,clojure]
----
(read-string "42")
;; -> 42
----

+read-string+ will convert integers, decimals and rationals. Rationals will be simplified.
[source,clojure]
----
(map read-string ["42" "-1" "+1337" "3.14" "-5.55" "2/4"])
;; -> (42 -1 1337 3.14 -5.55 1/2)
----

For cases when you may want to have more control and flexibility of the conversion process use regular expressions in combination with parsers for the number types.
[source,clojure]
----
(defn to-number [string]
  (cond (re-seq #"^[-+]?\d*[\.,]\d*$" string)
        (Double/parseDouble (clojure.string/replace string #"," "."))
        (re-seq #"^[-+]?\d+$" string)
        (Integer/parseInt (clojure.string/replace string #"\+" ""))
        :else string))

(map to-number ["42" "-1" "+1337" "1.5" "3,14" "-5.55" "some text"])
;; -> (42 -1 1337 1.5 3.14 -5.55 "some text")
----

===== Discussion
Note that +read-string+, while simple and straight forward, can execute code (controlled by *read-eval*), and should therefor be used only with trusted sources.

A function like +to-number+ can be very useful when reading CSV files that contains numbers.
