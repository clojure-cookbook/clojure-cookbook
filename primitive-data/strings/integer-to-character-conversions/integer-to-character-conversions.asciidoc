=== Converting Between Characters and Integers
[role="byline"]
by Ryan Neufeld

==== Problem

You need to convert characters to their respective code points (integer values) or vice versa.

==== Solution

Use the +int+ function to coerce a character to its integer value.

[source,clojure]
----
(int \a)
;; -> 97

(int \ø)
;; -> 248

(map int "Hello, world!")
;; -> (72 101 108 108 111 44 32 119 111 114 108 100 33)
----

Use the +char+ function to coerce an integer (or any other number type) back into a character.

[source,clojure]
----
(char 97)
;; -> \a

(char 125)
;; -> \}

(reduce #(str %1 (char %2))
        ""
        [115 101 99 114 101 116 32 109 101 115 115 97 103 101 115])
;; -> "secret messages"
----

==== Discussion

Converting between characters and integers is a simple matter in Clojure; merely use the +int+ and +char+ functions to coerce characters between their numerical and character forms.
