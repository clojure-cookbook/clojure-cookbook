==== "Adding" an item to a list

===== Problem

You want to add an item to a list; or, putting it in functional terms,
you want to derive a new list from an existing list which contains an
additional item.

===== Solution

Use the +conj+ function. +conj+ is used to add an item or items to a
logical collection, and is polymorphic, meaning it works on multiple
concrete data types, including lists.

[source,clojure]
----
(conj (list 1 2 3) 4)
;; -> (4 1 2 3)
----

Adding multiple items at once:

[source,clojure]
----
(conj (list 1 2 3) 4 5)
;; -> (5 4 1 2 3)
----

===== Discussion

The behavior of +conj+ may vary slightly depending on the concrete
type. It always "adds" an item to an immutable collection by returning
a new collection containing the new item, but may add the item to
different places in the collection depending on what is most efficient
for the particular type.

In the case of lists, +conj+ will always add the item at the
_beginning_ of the list, since a linked list data structure supports
constant-time insertion only at the beginning.

.+conj+ versus +cons+
****

If you are familiar with Common Lisp or Scheme, you were probably
expecting to see the +cons+ function used, instead of +conj+. Clojure
does have a +cons+ function, but it has a slightly different purpose.

While +conj+ will return a new concrete +clojure.lang.PersistentList+
(when used on a list), +cons+ will always construct a new _sequence_,
where the item added is the _first_ and the collection is the _rest_.

This distinction is subtle, especially since a
+clojure.lang.PersistentList+ and a sequence constructed using +cons+
are both types of persistent linked lists, algorithmically speaking.

The best way to think about it is that +conj+ is a concrete *data
structure* operation, which will not change the concrete type of the
data structure it is applied to, while +cons+ is a *sequence*
operation and only guarantees that it will return a sequence: in fact,
it returns a cons cell (+clojure.lang.Cons+) which implements the
sequence interface], no matter what type of seq-able collection you
gave it to start with.

Unlike +conj+, +cons+ is also guaranteed to return a sequence with the
item prepended to the beginning no matter what the collection type is.
