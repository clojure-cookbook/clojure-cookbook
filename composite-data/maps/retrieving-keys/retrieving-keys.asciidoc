==== Retreiving keys from a map

===== Problem

You want to get the value stored at a particular key from a map.

===== Solution

As with sets, there are several ways to retrieve keys by values.

The most straightforward way is to use the +get+ function, which given
a map and a key, returns the value stored at the key or +nil+ if the
map does not contain the key.

[source,clojure]
----
(get {:name "Kvothe" :class "Bard"} :name)
;; -> "Kvothe"

(get {:name "Kvothe" :class "Bard"} :race)
;; -> nil
----

If desired, you can also pass a third argument to be used as the
default return value instead of +nil+ if a map doesn't contain the key.

[source,clojure]
----
(get {:name "Kvothe" :class "Bard"} :race "Human")
;; -> "Human"
----

If your map uses keywords as keys, you can use the keyword itself as a
function. Keywords implement the +IFn+ interface, and when invoked
with a map as an argument, they will look themselves up in the map,
returning the value if it is present, or +nil+ if not. You can also
pass a second argument which will be used as a default return value in
the case of a missing key, just as you can with +get+.

[source,clojure]
----
(:name {:name "Marcus" :class "Paladin"})
;; -> "Marcus"

(:race {:name "Marcus" :class "Paladin"} "Human")
;; -> "Human"
----

Finally, the third basic way to look up a value in the map is to use
the map itself as a function, passing the key to be retrieved as the
argument. Like +get+ and keyword functions, it is also possible to
pass a second argument for use as a default value if the key is not
found, otherwise +nil+ is returned.

[source,clojure]
----
(def character {:name "Brock" :class "Barbarian"})

(character :name)
;; -> "Brock"

(character :race)
;; -> nil

(character :race "Human")
;; -> "Human"
----

There is a convenience function for looking up items in nested maps:
+get-in+. Instead of passing a single key, you can pass a sequence of
keys, and they will be successively looked up in a nested structure,
as if repeatedly calling +get+ on each level of the nested data
structure. +nil+ is returned if any key is missing.

[source,clojure]
----
(get-in {:name "Marcus" :weapon {:type :greatsword :damage "2d6"}}
        [:weapon :damage])
;; -> "2d6"

(get-in {:name "Marcus"}
        [:weapon :damage])
;; -> nil
----

+get-in+ also takes an optional default value, which will be returned
if _any_ key in the nested hierarchy is missing.

[source,clojure]
----
(get-in {:name "Marcus"}
        [:weapon :damage]
        "1d2 (fists)")
;; -> "1d2 (fists)"
----

Note that +get-in+ works with _any_ associative data structure, not
just maps. This means that it can be combined to work with (for
example) indices of vectors.

[source,clojure]
----
(get-in [{:name "Marcus" :class "Paladin"}
         {:name "Kvothe" :class "Bard"}
         {:name "Felter" :class "Druid"}]
        [1 :class])
;; -> "Bard"
----

===== Discussion

Which technique of the three discussed above is the best to use? All
have identical semantics, but in idiomatic Clojure they convey
different implications about the scenario in which they are used.

Typically, keyword-as-a-function lookup is used when maps are being
used as "objects" and the keys as "fields", where the map contains a
relatively small, well known set of keys, and when there is a
reasonable expectation that the key will actually be present.

The +get+ function or map-as-a-function lookup techniques, on the
other hand, are more frequently used with large maps where the set of
possible keys is more open-ended. There is less motivation for
choosing between the two; the only difference to be aware of is that
when the "map" provided is +nil+ for some reason, using it in function
position will throw an exception, while applying +get+ to +nil+ will
simply return +nil+.

It is interesting to note, as well, that the ability to use a map
itself as a function is not just an arbitrary convenience. In the
technical sense of the word "function", maps _are_ functions of keys
to values. Consider the following function definition and map:

[source,clojure]
----
(defn square [x] (* x x))
----

[source,clojure]
----
(def square {1 1, 2 4, 3 9, 4 16, 5 25})
----

Using an invocation of the form +(square 3)+, the caller can actually
be _agnostic_ to whether +square+ is a "real" function or a map. Of
course, the normally defined function has a number of advantages in
this case; for one, it has an unlimited domain instead of just the
keys enumerated. And the multiplication function is fairly fast, so
precomputing results is not a win. But in some cases, for functions
that do have a more naturally constrained domain and which are more
expensive to compute, being able to use a map implementation of a
function can be a real boon to performance.

Because all of the different techniques for retrieving values from a
map return +nil+ if the key is not present, special handling is
required if you need to differentiate the scenario in which a key
_does_ exist in a map, with a vlue of nil, and where the key does not
exist at all.

The easiest way to do this is to always provide a default value to be
returned in the case of a missing key. To be absolutely sure that you
can differentiate the default value from any possible value the map
might possibly contain, you can use a namespace-qualified keyword
(e.g, +::not-found+)

It is also possible to use the +contains?+ function, which takes a
collection and a key, and returns true if and only if the collection
has a specific entry for that key, even if the value is +nil+.

.The meaning of +contains?+
****

The exact behavior of the +contains?+ function is a frequent topic for
confusion, especially since several other languages have a function
with a similar name that does something different.

In Clojure, +contains?+ is _not_ a search function; it does not
inspect a collection to see if the item is present. Rather, it is a
_lookup_ function, and only works on associative or indexed
collections. In other languages, it is frequently named +containsKey+
or something similar.

This means it works as one would expect on maps and sets, returning
true if the specified key is a valid key or member in the
collection. But for vectors, it will return true only if passed an
integer between zero and the maximum index of the vector. And it will
throw an exception if used at all with a list or a sequence.
