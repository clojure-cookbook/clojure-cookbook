=== Communicating with Embedded Devices via MQTT
[role="byline"]
By Sandeep Nangia

==== Problem

You want to communicate with embedded devices (think "Internet of
things") using a publish/subscribe model.(((networking/web services, communicating with embedded devices)))(((Machine Head library)))((("machine-to-machine (M2M) communication")))(((protocols, MQTT)))((("MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport) protocol")))(((publish/subscribe models)))

==== Solution

Use https://github.com/clojurewerkz/machine_head[Machine Head], a
Clojure library that enables machine-to-machine (M2M) communication via the
http://mqtt.org/[MQTT] protocol. The protocol requires an existing
MQTT broker with which all devices (or machines) will communicate by
publishing messages or subscribing to messages on specific topics. You can use
the http://mosquitto.org/[Mosquitto] broker with its test installation at _tcp://test.mosquitto.org:1883_ (of course, you
need a functional Internet connection on your machine).

To follow along with this recipe, launch a REPL using +lein-try+:

[source,text]
----
$ lein try clojurewerkz/machine_head
----

To start, create a simple +connect-and-subscribe+ function that
listens to a topic and prints messages it receives:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clojurewerkz.machine-head.client :as mh])

(defn message-handler [topic meta payload]
  (let [p (apply str (map char payload))]
    (println "received " p "on topic " topic)))

(defn connect-and-subscribe [broker-addr topics subscriberid]
  (let [qos-levels (vec (repeat (count topics) 2)) ;; All at qos 2
        conn-sub (mh/connect broker-addr subscriberid)]
    (if (mh/connected? conn-sub)
      (do
        (mh/subscribe conn-sub topics message-handler {:qos qos-levels})
        conn-sub)))) ;; Return conn-sub for later mh/disconnect...

(def subscriberid (mh/generate-id))
;; or use a unique id
;; (def subscriberid "SNSubscriber01")

(connect-and-subscribe "tcp://test.mosquitto.org:1883"
                       ["SNControlNetwork/Florida/device1"] subscriberid)
----

Open another terminal window and start a second +lein-try+ REPL session.
Use the following code to publish messages to the broker. Note that
subscriber must be connected already so as not to lose incoming
messages:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clojurewerkz.machine-head.client :as mh])

(defn connect-and-publish [broker-addr client-id topic]
  (let [qos 2
        retained false
        conn  (mh/connect broker-addr client-id)]
    (if (mh/connected? conn)
      (do (dotimes [n 5]
            (let [payload (str "msg" n)]
              (mh/publish conn topic payload qos retained)
              (println "published " payload)))
          (mh/disconnect conn)))))

(def pubclientid (mh/generate-id))
pubclientid
;; -> "ryan.1384135173618"

(connect-and-publish "tcp://test.mosquitto.org:1883" pubclientid
                       "SNControlNetwork/Florida/device1")
;; *out* of publish REPL
;; published  msg0
;; published  msg1
;; published  msg2
;; published  msg3
;; published  msg4
;; *out* of client REPL
;; received  msg0 on topic  SNControlNetwork/Florida/device1
;; received  msg1 on topic  SNControlNetwork/Florida/device1
;; received  msg2 on topic  SNControlNetwork/Florida/device1
;; received  msg3 on topic  SNControlNetwork/Florida/device1
;; received  msg4 on topic  SNControlNetwork/Florida/device1

==== Discussion

http://mqtt.org[MQTT] is an open, lightweight publish/subscribe
messaging protocol. It is useful for connections where bandwidth is at
a premium and/or connections are unreliable. While the AMQP protocol excels
at various scenarios for business messaging, MQTT is usually the
choice for smaller payloads and last-mile connectivity because it is simple
to implement in hardware. The MQTT protocol has the following properties
that make it good for constrained networks:

   * Designed for devices with limited resources, like
     battery-operated 8-bit controllers.
   * Internally compresses into bitwise headers and
     variable-length fields. The smallest possible packet size is a
     mere two bytes.
   * No polling required. Implements asynchronous bidirectional push delivery
     of messages.
   * Supports always-connected and sometimes-connected models.
   * Tested with low-bandwidth networks like VSAT and GPRS.

The protocol defines three possible Quality of Service (QoS) values: +0+, +1+, and +2+,
corresponding to fire-and-forget, at-least-once, and exactly-once
qualities of service. QoS parameters +1+ and +2+ require persistent
storage on the client so as to save the message until an acknowledgment
arrives. In the preceding recipe, the default persistence implementation
provided by the library is used.

MQTT also has a concept of retention of messages. If you were to set
+retained+ to +true+ in the +connect-and-publish+ function, the broker
would remember the last known retained message on the topic. When the
subscriber connects, it is given the last message (for which
+retained+ was +true+) by the broker and does not have to wait to
receive the first message.

[NOTE]
====
WebSphere and http://bit.ly/rmq-mqtt[RabbitMQ] also
implement MQTT and can be used instead of Mosquitto. While the preceding
code used the Mosquitto test broker (_tcp://test.mosquitto.org:1883_), you can
install your own Mosquitto broker using the
http://bit.ly/mosquitto-broker[MQTT
installation instructions].

The topics are usually defined with the separator +/+ defining
hierarchies. As an example, the sensor devices of a particular domain,
+SNControl+, might be publishing their values to
+SNControl/Florida/device1+, +SNControl/Florida/device2+, and so on.
Meanwhile, the devices in domain +RKNControl+ might publish their values to
+RKNControl/Washington/device1+, for example. Naming the topics in this way
helps in subscribing to multiple topics based on wildcards.

This is how wildcards are used:

+/+::
Used as a separator.

`+`::
The single-level wildcard and can appear anywhere in the string.

+#+::
A multilevel wildcard and needs to appear at the end of the string.

For example, these subscriptions are possible:

+SNControl/#+::
Any device under +SNControl+ (e.g., +SNControl/Florida/device1/sensor1+, +SNControl/Florida/device1/sensor2+ and +SNControl/California/device1+) will match.

`SNControl/+/device1`::
Any +device1+ in states under domain +SNControl+ will match(e.g., +SNControl/Florida/device1+ and +SNControl/California/device1+).

`SNControl/+/+/sensor1`::
Any +sensor1+ in states under domain +SNControl+ will match (e.g., +SNControl/Florida/device1/sensor1+ and +SNControl/Florida/device2/sensor1+).

In the preceding code, the +connect-and-subscribe+ method uses the
callback handler +message-handler+ to process incoming messages
arriving from the broker. In the +connect-and-subscribe+ method, the
+connect+ method from the Machine Head library is invoked by providing it
the broker address and client ID (generated using +generate-id+, or
some other unique ID). Then it checks that the connection has been
established using the +connected?+ method. The +subscribe+ method is
invoked with the connection, a vector of topics to subscribe to, a message
handler, and a +:qos+ option. The subscriber then waits for some time
and disconnects using the +disconnect+ method.

The +connect-and-publish+ method calls the method +connect+, which
accepts the broker address and client ID and returns the connection
+conn+. Then it checks if the connection is successful with the
+connected?+ method and invokes the +publish+ method to publish
messages (a few times) to the broker. The +publish+ method accepts as parameters the
connection, topic string, payload, QoS value, and +retained+. The QoS value of +2+ corresponds to exactly-once delivery. The +retained+ value of +false+ instructs the broker not to retain messages.
Finally, the +disconnect+ method disconnects from the broker.

While the preceding code fragment just prints the incoming messages, you
could potentially use the messages in some other way (e.g., triggering
some actions based on an alarm that the code has received).
