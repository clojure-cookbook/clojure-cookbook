=== Traversing Datomic Indexes
[role="byline"]
by Alan Busby and Ryan Neufeld

==== Problem

You want to execute simple Datomic queries with high performance.(((Datomic database, querying)))(((queries, simple Datomic)))

==== Solution

Use the +datomic.api/datoms+ function to directly access the core
Datomic indexes in your database.

To follow along with this recipe, first complete the recipes for <<sec_datomic_connect_to_datomic>>, and
<<sec_datomic_schema>>. 

For example, to quickly find the entities that have the provided attribute and
value set, invoke +datomic.api/datoms+, specifying the +:avet+ index
(attribute, value, entity, transaction) and the desired attribute and
value:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[datomic.api :as d])

(d/transact conn [{:db/id (d/tempid :db.part/user)
                   :user/name "Barney Rubble"
                   :user/email "barney@rubble.me"}])

(defn entities-with-attr-val
  "Return entities with a given attribute and value."
  [db attr val]
  (->> (d/datoms db :avet attr val)
       (map :e)
       (map (partial d/entity db))))


(def barney (first (entities-with-attr-val (d/db conn)
                                           :user/email
                                           "barney@rubble.me")))

(:user/email barney)
;; -> "barney@example.com"
----

[WARNING]
====
This will only work for attributes where +:db/index+ is +true+ or
+:db/unique+ is not +nil+.
====

To quickly determine all of the attributes an entity has, use the
+:eavt+-ordered index:

[source,clojure]
----
(defn entities-attrs
  "Return attrs of an entity"
  [db entity]
  (->> (d/datoms db :eavt (:db/id entity))
       (map :a)
       (map (partial d/entity db))
       (map :db/ident)))

(entities-attrs (d/db conn) barney)
;; -> (:user/email :user/name)
----

To quickly find entities that refer, via +:db.type/ref+, to a provided
entity, use the +:vaet+-ordered index:

[source,clojure]
----
;; Add a person that refers to a :user.roles/author role
(d/transact conn [{:db/id (d/tempid :db.part/user)
                   :user/name "Ryan Neufeld"
                   :user/email "ryan@rkn.io"
                   :user/roles [:user.roles/author :user.roles/editor]}])

(defn referring-to
  "Find all entities referring to an entity as a certain attribute."
  [db entity]
  (->> (d/datoms db :vaet (:db/id entity) )
       (map :e)
       (map (partial d/entity db))))

(def author-entity (d/entity (d/db conn) :user.roles/author))

;; The names of all users with a :user.roles/author role
(map :user/name (referring-to (d/db conn) author-entity))
;; -> ("Ryan Neufeld")
----

==== Discussion

For simple lookup queries, like "find by attribute" or "find by
value", nothing beats Datomic's raw indexes in terms of performance.
The +datomic.api/datoms+ interface provides access to all of Datomic's
indexes and conveniently lets you dive in any number of levels,
"biting off" only the data you need.

As with most Datomic functions, +datoms+ takes a +db+ as its first
argument. You'll note that in our examples, and elsewhere in the book, we
too accept a database as a value, and not a connection--this idiom
allows API users to perform varying numbers of operations on the same
database value. You should always try to do this yourself.

The second argument to +datoms+ indicates the particular index you want to access.
Each value is a permutation of the letters +e+ (entity), +a+ (attribute), +v+ (value),
and +t+ (transaction). The order of the letters in an index indicates how it
is indexed. For example, +:eavt+ should be traversed by entity, then
attribute, and so on and so forth. The four indexes and what they
include are as follows:

+:eavt+::
An entity-first index that includes all datoms. This
  index provides a view over your database very much like a
  traditional relational database.

+:aevt+::
An attribute-then-entity index that includes all datoms. This
  index provides columnar access to your database, much like a data
  warehouse.

+:avet+::
An attribute-value index that only includes attributes
  where +:db/index+ is +true+. Incredibly useful as a lookup index
  (e.g., "I need the entity with an email of pass:[<emphasis>foo@example.com</emphasis>]&#8221;).

+:vaet+::
A value-first index that only includes +:db.type/ref+
  values. This is a very interesting index that can be used to treat your data
  a bit like a graph database.

After specifying an index ordering, you can optionally provide any
number of components to pre-traverse the index. This serves to reduce
the number of elements returned. For example, specifying just an
attribute component for AVET traversal will return any entity with
that attribute. Specifying an attribute and a value component, on the
other hand, will return only entities with that specific attribute and
value pair.

What is returned by +datoms+ is a stream of +Datum+ objects. Each
datum responds to +:a+, +:e+, +t+, +:v+, and +:added+ as functions.(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_DBdt")))
