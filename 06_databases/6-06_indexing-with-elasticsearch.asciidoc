=== Indexing Data with ElasticSearch
[role="byline"]
by Michael Klishin

==== Problem

You want to index data using the
http://elasticsearch.org[ElasticSearch] indexing and search engine.(((databases, indexing data)))(((searching, search engines)))(((indexing)))(((ElasticSearch)))(((Elastisch)))

==== Solution

Use http://bit.ly/clj-elastisch[Elastisch], a minimalistic
Clojure wrapper around the ElasticSearch Java APIs.

In order to successfully work through the examples in this recipe, you
should have ElasticSearch installed and running on your local
system. You can find details on how to install it on
http://bit.ly/cc-es-setup[the
ElasticSearch website].

ElasticSearch supports multiple transports (e.g., HTTP, native
Netty-based transport, and Memcached). Elastisch supports HTTP and
native transports.  This recipe will use an HTTP transport client for
the examples and explain how to switch to the native transport in the
discussion section.

To follow along with this recipe, add `[clojurewerkz/elastisch "1.2.0"]` to your project's dependencies, or start a REPL using +lein-try+:

[source,text]
----
$ lein try clojurewerkz/elastisch
----

Before you can index and search with Elastisch, it is necessary to
tell Elastisch what ElasticSearch node to use. To use the HTTP
transport, you use the +clojurewerkz.elastisch.rest/connect!+ function
that takes an endpoint as its sole argument:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clojurewerkz.elastisch.rest :as esr])

(esr/connect! "http://127.0.0.1:9200")
----

===== Indexing

Before data can be searched over, it needs to be indexed. Indexing is
the process of scanning the text and building a list of search terms
and data structures called a _search index_. Search indexes allow
search engines such as ElasticSearch to efficiently retrieve relevant documents
for a query.(((data, indexing prior to search)))(((searching, search index)))

The process of indexing involves a few steps:

. Create an index.
. [Optional] Define mappings (how documents should be indexed).
. Submit documents for indexing via HTTP or other APIs.

To create an index, use the +clojurewerkz.elastisch.rest.index/create+ function:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clojurewerkz.elastisch.rest.index :as esi])

(esr/connect! "http://127.0.0.1:9200")

;; Create an index with the given settings and no custom mapping types
(esi/create "test1")

;; Create an index with custom settings
(esi/create "test2" :settings {"number_of_shards" 1}))
----

A full explanation of the available indexing settings is outside the
scope of this recipe. Please refer to the
http://bit.ly/clj-es-indexing[Elastisch
documentation on indexing] for full details.

===== Creating mappings

_Mappings_ define the fields in a document and what the indexing(((mappings, field definition for)))((("fields, defining")))
characteristics are for each field. Mapping types are specified when
an index is created using the +:mapping+ option:

[source,clojure]
----
(esr/connect! "http://127.0.0.1:9200")

;; Mapping types map structure is the same as in the ElasticSearch API reference
(def mapping-types {"person"
                    {:properties {:username  {:type "string" :store "yes"}
                                 :first-name {:type "string" :store "yes"}
                                 :last-name  {:type "string"}
                                 :age        {:type "integer"}
                                 :title      {:type "string" 
                                              :analyzer "snowball"}
                                 :planet     {:type "string"}
                                 :biography  {:type "string"
                                              :analyzer "snowball"
                                              :term_vector
                                              "with_positions_offsets"}}}})

(esi/create "test3" :mappings mapping-types)))
----

===== Indexing documents

To add a document to an index, use the
+clojurewerkz.elastisch.rest.document/create+ function. This will
cause a document ID to be generated automatically:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clojurewerkz.elastisch.rest.document :as esd])

(esr/connect! "http://127.0.0.1:9200")

(def mapping-types {"person"
                    {:properties {:username  {:type "string" :store "yes"}
                                 :first-name {:type "string" :store "yes"}
                                 :last-name  {:type "string"}
                                 :age        {:type "integer"}
                                 :title      {:type "string" :analyzer "snowball"}
                                 :planet     {:type "string"}
                                 :biography  {:type "string"
                                              :analyzer "snowball"
                                              :term_vector
                                              "with_positions_offsets"}}}})

(esi/create "test4" :mappings mapping-types)

(def doc {:username "happyjoe"
          :first-name "Joe"
          :last-name "Smith"
          :age 30
          :title "The Boss"
          :planet "Earth"
          :biography "N/A"})


(esd/create "test4" "person" doc)
;; => {:ok true, :_index people, :_type person,
;;     :_id "2vr8sP-LTRWhSKOxyWOi_Q", :_version 1}
----

+clojurewerkz.elastisch.rest.document/put+ will add a document to the index but expects a document ID to be provided:

[source,clojure]
----
(esr/put "test4" "person" "happyjoe" doc)
----

==== Discussion

Whenever a document is added to the ElasticSearch index, it is first
analyzed.(((tokenization)))(((filtering)))(((document analysis)))

_Analysis_ is a process of several stages:

 * Tokenization (breaking field values into _tokens_)
 * Filtering or modifying tokens
 * Combining tokens with field names to produce _terms_

How exactly a document was analyzed defines what search queries will
match (find) it. ElasticSearch is based on
http://lucene.apache.org[Apache Lucene] and offers several analyzers
developers can use to achieve the kind of search quality and
performance they need. For example, different languages
require different analyzers: English, Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, and
Russian cannot be analyzed the same way.

It is possible to skip performing analysis for fields and specify whether
field values are stored in the index or not. Fields that are not
stored still can be searched over but will not be included into search
results.

ElasticSearch allows users to define exactly how different kinds of
documents are indexed, analyzed, and stored.

ElasticSearch has excellent support for _multitenancy_: an
ElasticSearch cluster can have a virtually unlimited number of indexes
and mapping types.  For example, you can use a separate index per user
account or organization in a SaaS (Software as a Service) product.(((multi-tenancy)))

There are two ways to index a document with ElasticSearch: you can submit a document
for indexing without an ID or update a document with a provided ID,
in which case if the document already exists, it will be updated (a
new version will be created).

While it is fine and common to use automatically created indexes early
in development, manually creating indexes lets you configure a lot
about how ElasticSearch will index your data and, in turn, what kinds
of queries it will be possible to execute against it.

How your data is indexed is primarily controlled by _mappings_. They
define which fields in documents are indexed, if/how they are
analyzed, and if they are stored. Each index in ElasticSearch may have
one or more _mapping types_. Mapping types can be thought of as tables
in a database (although this analogy does not always stand).  Mapping
types are the heart of indexing in ElasticSearch and provide access to
a lot of ElasticSearch functionality.(((mappings, mapping types)))

For example, a blogging application may have types such as _article_,
_comment_, and _person_. Each has distinct _mapping settings_ that
define a set of fields documents of the type have, how they are
supposed to be indexed (and, in turn, what kinds of queries will be
possible over them), what language each field is in, and so on. Getting
mapping types right for your application is the key to a good search
experience. It also takes time and experimentation.(((mappings, mapping settings)))

Mapping types define document fields and their core types
(e.g., string, integer, or date/time). Settings are provided to
ElasticSearch as a JSON document, and this is how they are documented
on the
http://bit.ly/cc-es-mapping[ElasticSearch
site].

With Elastisch, mapping settings are specified as Clojure maps with
the same structure (schema). A very minimalistic example:

[source,clojure]
----
{"tweet" {:properties {:username  {:type "string" :index "not_analyzed"}}}}
----

Here is a brief and very incomplete list of things that you can define
via mapping settings:

 * Document fields, their types, and whether they are analyzed
 * Document time to live (TTL)
 * Whether a document type is indexed
 * Special fields (`"_all"`, default field, etc.)
 * http://bit.ly/cc-es-boost-field[Document-level boosting]
 * http://bit.ly/cc-es-timestamp-field[Timestamp field]

When an index is created using the
`clojurewerkz.elastisch.rest.index/create` function, mapping settings
are passed with the `:mappings` option, as seen previously.

When it is necessary to update mapping for an index, you can use the
+clojurewerkz.elastisch.rest.index/update-mapping+ function:

[source,clojure]
----
(esi/update-mapping "myapp_development" "person"
                    :mapping {:properties
                              {:first-name {:type "string" :store "no"}}})
----

In a mapping configuration, settings are passed as maps where keys are
names (strings or keywords) and values are maps of the actual
settings. In this example, the only setting is `:properties`, which
defines a single field--a string that is not analyzed:

[source,clojure]
----
{"tweet" {:properties {:username  {:type "string" :index "not_analyzed"}}}}
----

There is much more to the indexing and mapping options, but that's outside the scope of a
single recipe. See the Elastisch
http://bit.ly/clj-es-indexing[indexing
documentation] for an exhaustive list of the capabilities provided.
