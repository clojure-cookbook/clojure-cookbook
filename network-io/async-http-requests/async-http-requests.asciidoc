=== Perform an asynchronous HTTP request
[role="byline"]
by Alan Busby

==== Problem

You want to perform an asynchronous HTTP request.

==== Solution

Using +HTTP-Kit+, http://http-kit.org/

With a callback function.

[source,clojure]
----
(org.httpkit.client/get "http://www.host.com/path"
                        {:timeout      200 ;; ms
                         :basic-auth   ["username" "password]
              	         :query-params {:parameter "value"}}
                        (fn [{:keys [status headers body error]}]
                          (if error
                            (binding [*out* *err*]
              	              (println "Failed with, " error))
                            (println body))))
----

With a Clojure promise.

[source,clojure]
----
(let [{:keys [body error]} @(org.httpkit.client/post "http://www.host.com/path"
                                                     {:form-params {:foo "bar"}})]
  (if error
    (binding [*out* *err*]
      (println "Failed with, " error))
    (println body)))

==== Discussion

As the bulk of time spent performing HTTP requests is establishing the connection
and awaiting the server's response, asynchronous requests enable your application
to continue working while awaiting the delivery of data.

In this vein HTTP-Kit provides both a highly concurrent web server, as well a
powerful HTTP client. It offers both callbacks and promises for asynchronous
requests, as well as persistent connections and alternate SSL Engines for dealing
with unsigned SSL certificates.
