=== Introduction

More and more these days it seems like every system we build has to
talk to something, somewhere footnote:[In fact,
http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2482856[There's Just No Getting
around It: You're Building a Distributed System].]. Like
<<ch_local_io>>, we'd hardly be doing anything at all if we didn't
actually talk with some other process.

This chapter covers all of the normal communication modes you would
expect--HTTP, TCP, UDP and the like--as well as some newcomers footnote:[As
Australian songwriter Peter Allen so accurately put: "Everything old
is new again"], namely message-oriented architectures.
