=== Sending a Ping Request

// By Jason Webb (bigjason)

===== Problem

You want to ping an IP address to check availability.

===== Solution

Use the java +java.net/InetAddress+ class to test if the address +isReachable+.

[source,clojure]
----
(.isReachable (java.net.InetAddress/getByName "oreilly.com") 5000)
;; -> true
----

===== Discussion

Using +isReachable+ works great if the correct permissions can be obtained.  On
a typical Unix like implementation you will need to start your Clojure instance with
+sudo+ to get an actual ICMP ping sent.  Otherwise a standard connection will
be attempted on port 7, which in most cases will be blocked by a firewall.  More
information can be found in the Java docs (see footnote below).

A common need when pinging another machine is to time the ping.  A quick macro
can be used for this.

[source,clojure]
----
(defmacro wrap-time
  "Evaluates expr and returns {:milliseconds :exp-result}"
  [expr]
  `(let [start# (. System (nanoTime))
         ret# ~expr
         total# (/ (double (- (. System (nanoTime)) start#)) 1000000.0)]
     {:time (if (not (contains? #{:timeout :error} ret#)) total# 0)
      :result ret#}))

(wrap-time (.isReachable (java.net.InetAddress/getByName "oreilly.com") 5000))
;; -> {:result true, :time 187.255}
